<p>The Node Material is a new kind of material available from Babylon.js v4.1. It will let you create a new material by assembling building blocks, or nodes, quickly and easily. These nodes define how vertex and pixel shaders will behave by assembling the nodes in the order needed.</p>
<p>This way you will be in control of everything related to the rendering of our meshes without having to learn GLSL. Furthermore, thanks to our library of predefined nodes, you will be able to reuse entire portions of the Babylon.js engine by just adding a new node for lighting, fog, bones, etc..</p>
